# Gorlot Engine

Gorlot Engine is a 3D Game engine coded in JavaScript, based in Three.JS and nunuStudio.

## Screenshots
**Note:** The GUI can change, and the graphics WILL vary. Don't base yourself in these screenshots, you'd better download the source code and test it out (It's nothing but 3 MB worth - for now -)
